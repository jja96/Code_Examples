PWM or Pulse width modulation

PWM is a special set of pins on Arduino boards denoted by ~ next to the digital I/O pin cabable of PWM

copied from the arduino PWM page:

Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means.
Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off.
This on-off pattern can simulate voltages in between full on (5 Volts) and off (0 Volts)
by changing the portion of the time the signal spends on versus the time that the signal spends off.
The duration of "on time" is called the pulse width.
To get varying analog values, you change, or modulate, that pulse width.
If you repeat this on-off pattern fast enough with an LED for example, the result is as if the signal
is a steady voltage between 0 and 5v controlling the brightness of the LED.

This example can be extended to many devices such as controlling motor speed.

**IMPORTNANT**
CARE MUST BE TAKEN WHEN DESIGNING A CIRCUIT IMPLEMENTING PWM
ENSURE YOU ARE USING PWM PINS FROM YOUR ARDUINO
ALSO ENSURE ALL OF YOUR ELECRICAL COMPONENTS ARE DESIGNED FOR PWM
NOT ALL TRANSISTORS LIKE PWM AND SOME WILL FAIL POTENTIALLY DESTROYING OTHER ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS
ADDITIONALLY IF USING A TRANSISTOR AND PWM TO CONTROLL DC MOTOR SPEED,
	MAKE SURE A FLY BACK DIODE IS USED TO PROTECT THE TRANSISTOR
